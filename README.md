Support Arms Machine Screws:
M5x30mm 0.8 Pitch (25mm can also be used)

Moving Arms Hex Bolt:
M4x30mm, with matching Wing Nuts


Tutorial:  Print out everything, I used 50% infill.  Remove bolts from Z Axis plate, and replace with M5x30mm, attach arms using Hex Bolts going through from the back sides, secure arms with wing nuts.  For boot, trim brusges (I trimed mine to about 1.4 inches from the top) and attach to base using mounting tape or hot glue.  Insert magnets in base and fill remaining area with hot glue so they don't come out.  Put matching magnets on moveable arms, then secure from outside with high strength tape or hot glue.  You are now done and can reposition arms by loosening wing nuts, and can slide base in and out to change bits, zero etc.  Made for 30mm diameter (measuring from outside) vacuum hoses, but adapters may be used to wider hoses.
